# `gnote` Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

To enable syntax highlighting in Sublime, the `sublime/gnote/` directory will need to be added to your Sublime packages directory.

First, locate your OS-specific Sublime package directory. You can do this in Sublime under _Settings... > Browse Packages..._

Then, copy `sublime/gnote/` into the package directory. 

If you intend on modifying anything and want to avoid shuffling around your changes, you can instead create a symbolic link. On MacOS, this may look like:
```
ln -s <path to repository>/sublime/gnote <path to packages directory>
```
